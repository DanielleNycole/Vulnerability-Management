# Vulnerability-Management

<h2>Description</h2>

I set up a Virtual Machine and opened it up to vulnerabilities. From there I ran Nessus scans and experiemented with the settings and applications on the Virtual Machine to see what would trigger critical vulnerabilities and now to remidiate them.<br/>

Set up the VM:  <br/>

I ran an initial Nessus Scan and included the admin credentials to take a deep dive and get as much information as possible up front.

I then installed an outdated version of Firefox into the VM to test how the results of the scan would change. I then reviewd the remediations that came back. Once I saw that there wer more critical responses due to the outdated applications, I updated my version of FireFox and those critical vulnerabilites were gone. 

<h2>Programs Used </h2>

- <b>Oracle VM VirtualBox </b> 
- <b>Windows 10</b>
- <b>Nessus</b>

<h2>Problems I ran into and how I solved them</h2>
<b>When setting up the VM, I was having trouble getting Nessus to scan. I attempted to ping the VM from my personal computer. I knew if I couldn't get the VM from my personal computer, Nessus wouldn't be able to scan either. Using this helped me identify that it was due to the network connection and I was able to adjust those settings with my VM
